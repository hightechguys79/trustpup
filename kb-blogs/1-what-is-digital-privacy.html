      <h2>1. What is Digital Privacy?</h2>

      <h3>What</h3>
      <p>
        Digital privacy is about giving individuals control over their <strong>personal information in the digital world</strong>.
        It‚Äôs the invisible seatbelt ü™ëüîí that keeps your online identity safe whether you‚Äôre shopping, streaming, or scrolling.
        Think names, emails, geolocation pings, purchase history, and even the way you swipe on your phone‚Äîthese are all
        data points that, stitched together, form a pretty personal portrait of you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regulations like <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GDPR</a> in Europe and
        <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CCPA</a> in California define privacy
        as the right to know what‚Äôs collected, to say ‚Äúno thanks‚Äù to certain uses, and to hit delete when you want out.
      </p>

      <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Without protections, that portrait of you can end up in the wrong hands‚Äîor just too many hands. A breach or an
        overzealous marketer could turn your late-night shopping spree into spam, price discrimination, or worse, identity
        theft. For businesses, bad privacy = legal risk + lost trust. Customers <em>expect</em> their data to be handled
        carefully. When it isn‚Äôt, the fallout is expensive (<a href="https://money.cnn.com/2017/05/23/technology/target-breach-settlement/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Target‚Äôs 2013 breach</a>
        cost over $200M in settlements üí∏).
      </p>

      <h3>Example</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Amazon:</strong> Collects browsing &amp; purchase history to fuel recommendations. Done right: magical ‚ú® (‚Äúyou always know what I want!‚Äù). Done wrong: creepy üò¨ (‚Äúhow did you know I needed that medicine?‚Äù).</li>
        <li><strong>Walmart:</strong> Uses loyalty card data to optimize inventory &amp; predict demand. Powerful, but misuse could expose sensitive household patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Hospitals store patient data; HIPAA requires strict privacy to avoid leaks of medical info.</li>
        <li><strong>Tech/Social Media:</strong> Platforms thrive on engagement data, but must balance personalization vs. invasive profiling.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How (Starter Pack)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Limit exposure:</strong> Only share what‚Äôs needed (does a news site really need your birthday?).</li>
        <li><strong>Check policies:</strong> Look for notices written in human, not legalese.</li>
        <li><strong>Exercise rights:</strong> Use access and deletion portals under GDPR, CCPA, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Businesses:</strong> Map data flows, apply encryption &amp; retention limits, and provide self-serve DSR portals.</li>
      </ul>
